# Counting Words

__Skill Level:__ Intermediate  
__Time Limit:__ 15-20 minutes

Variations of this challenge are pretty common in code interviews and phone screens for software engineering. The task may differ but the fundamentals are usually pretty much the same - Given a file, read it, and parse the data.

## Instructions
- Read the `speech.txt` file and display a count of the most commonly used words in the document.
- Your list of commonly used words should be human readable and in descending order by count.

## Things to Think About
- What would you test first?
- What are the edge cases?
- Is your solution object oriented? 

## Example

Given: "The cat is tall. The cat is much bigger than the mouse."

Then:
```
3 - the
2 - cat
2 - is
1 - much
1 - tall
1 - bigger
1 - than
1 - mouse
```
